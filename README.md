# Keep score

A one-page web app for keeping score. **Work in progress.**

## Development

To set up, you'll need Node installed. Then, in this root directory run `npm install`. Setup complete.

To work, run (i.e. type and hit enter) `gulp` at the command line in this root directory.

This will launch the web app in your browser, watch for changes you make to the files in `src`, and refresh your browser automatically.
