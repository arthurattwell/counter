# Counter

A one-page web app for keeping score. **Work in progress.**

## Development

To set up, you'll need Node installed. Then, in this root directory run `npm install`. Setup complete.

To work, run `gulp` in the root. This will launch the web app in your browser, watch for changes you make to the files in `src`, and refresh your browser automatically.
