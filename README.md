# Keep score

A simple web app for keeping score. I made it for playing MTG, and it's probably useful for other games, too.

Once you've set your starting totals and chosen your colours, tap the middle button to go full screen.

It'll save your game state in your browser for next time.


## Development

To set up, you'll need Node installed. Then, in this root directory run `npm install`. Setup complete.

To start working, run (i.e. type and hit enter) `gulp` at the command line in this root directory.

This will launch the web app in your browser, watch for changes you make to the files in `src`, and refresh your browser automatically.

Do not edit any files in `public` â€“ those are generated automatically from `src`.
